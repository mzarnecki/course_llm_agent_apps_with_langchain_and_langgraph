Operating expenses grew 5% as R&D increased 5% to 8% of sales. Net income fell 3% to $93.7 billion, though profit margin remained high at 24%. Compared to prior years, revenue growth has slowed while expenses rose faster than sales. However, the company maintains strong profitability with substantial cash flows, and services continue to drive higher-margin growth suggesting revenue increases remain sustainable through further expansion of recurring streams.\",\n",

Overall, the company demonstrated fiscal resilience through prudent financial management.\\n\\n2023: Liquidity was maintained as current assets still outweighed current liabilities. Declining debt and steady equity implied enhanced repayment capacity and shareholder value. Capital investments grew assets and margins, demonstrating productive resource allocation. The financial position remained robust, with flexibility to navigate challenges.\\n\\n2022: Favorable liquidity was shown in current assets comfortably covering current debt obligations. Leverage was reasonably low while shareholder equity expanded. Steady profitability helped reinvest in innovations and return capital.
