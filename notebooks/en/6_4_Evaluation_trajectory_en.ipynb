    "## Trajectory evaluation\n",
    "Trajectory evaluation compares a model's reasoning steps (prediction) with a reference sequence, assessing the consistency, order, and completeness of each step. It detects not only an incorrect final answer but also where a deviation occurred in the reasoning chain (e.g., a missed or distorted step), making it particularly useful for agents and multi-step tasks."
